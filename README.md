## Managing your account 
Sign up for an account to add books to your want to read list and then manage once you are reading it and once you are complete. 

## Using Clubs
Create a club, invite your friends and keep a record of what you want to read, what you currently are reading and what you have read in your club.

Anyone who is a memeber of the group can add books they want to read to the list.

Only the clubs admin user can update when you are reading the book and when you have finished.

Only the clubs admin user can delete and invite people to the club.

# Development Process

### Bugs and Updates / Pain points

- When you had a book to more than one of your book clubs the display is incorrect. In general the way the code is set up to display if the book is already in you book club or if you want to add it to your book club needs to be cleaned up
- Using the Google API was tricky as you couldn't reley on the data returned to be consistant 
- When you want to return an array of data from the database but it can sometimes be empty 

### Plan Break Down

- Two idea: book managmenet and book club management
